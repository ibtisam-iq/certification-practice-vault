# Certification Practice Vault

A focused, execution-first vault of real exam-style practice questions and scenarios for DevOps and Cloud certifications — starting with Kubernetes (CKA / CKAD) and expanding over time.

## What This Project Is

This repository is a **living practice vault** I built while preparing for cloud and DevOps certifications.

Instead of treating certifications as a one-time achievement, I documented **everything I actually did** while preparing:

- questions I struggled with
- commands I ran
- mistakes I made
- terminal outputs
- debugging paths
- explanations that finally made things click

What you see here is **not theory written after success** —
it is work captured **during preparation**.

## Project Objective

This project serves three clear purposes:

1. **Proof of Work**
   Each certification here is backed by real, hands-on execution — not just a badge or PDF.

2. **Reusable Practice Vault**
   Over time, this repository becomes a growing vault of realistic practice material for future certifications (Terraform, AWS, KCNA, CKS, etc.).

3. **Public Learning Asset**
   Anyone preparing for the same certifications can use this vault to understand *how problems are solved*, not just what the answers are.

## How the Content Was Created

All questions and scenarios here come from **real preparation work**, primarily using:

- **Killercoda labs**
- **KodeKloud labs and practice environments**
- Self-designed variations while experimenting
- Failures and corrections discovered through hands-on work

When something failed, I documented **why**.

When something worked, I kept the **exact terminal output**.

This is deliberate.

## How to Use This Vault

- Pick a certification or domain
- Read the question carefully
- Follow the terminal output and steps
- Notice *why* something failed or succeeded
- Re-run the commands yourself

If you can execute what’s written **without guessing**, you are genuinely exam-ready.

---

## Important Notes

- This is **not polished documentation**
- Explanations may include raw, AI-assisted troubleshooting
- Language reflects real-time problem solving
- Content favors **execution over theory**

All of this is intentional.

---

## Project Status

This is an **ongoing engineering project**.

As I prepare for more certifications, new folders and practice material will be added following the same philosophy:
> *learn by doing, document while doing*

If you’re looking for perfect notes, this is not that.

If you want to see **how real preparation actually happens**, you’re in the right place.
