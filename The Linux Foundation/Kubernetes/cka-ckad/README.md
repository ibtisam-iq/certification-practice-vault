# CKA & CKAD Practice Vault

This folder is a **real practice vault** built while preparing for the
**Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)** and
**Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)** exams.

It contains **actual exam-style questions**, **terminal outputs**, and **reasoning captured during problem-solving** — not rewritten theory.

---

## What This Is

- Hands-on Kubernetes practice
- Question-first, solution-driven
- Built while preparing for **CKA & CKAD together**
- Organized by **Linux Foundation exam domains**
- Preserved as-is to reflect real thinking under pressure

---

## Where These Questions Came From

This vault was built through **intensive, repeated lab-based practice**, primarily using:

- **KodeKloud** — deep, repetitive lab execution
- **Killercoda** — scenario-based Kubernetes problem solving
- Supplemented with targeted exploration via documentation and experimentation

Every question here is the result of:

- something I failed
- something I misunderstood
- or something I had to debug under time pressure

Nothing here is theoretical or invented.
